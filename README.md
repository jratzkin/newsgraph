# newsgraph

The long-term goal of this project is to provide the user with a visualization of the history attached to a given news story. We would like to do this by having the user input a link to a news story, from which we would generate a graph whose nodes are the other stories cited in the original article the user submitted, connected by edges corresponding to the citations. We would also like to implement automatic summarization, which would describe the thrust of a given story in a sentence or two. The user could see the title and/or summary of a story by mousing over the corresponding node.
